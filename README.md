**Write less code and say less about it.** Honey (I Shrunk the AI) by
[GreenPT](https://github.com/Green-PT) is a
cross-tool coding skill that cuts AI coding-agent token usage and LLM API costs —
making agents emit less code *and* less prose without losing correctness. It works
with **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Cline,
and Kiro**. Three independent levers, applied reflexively:

1. **Less code** — YAGNI first. Walk a ladder (does it need to exist? → stdlib →
   language native → existing dependency → one line → minimum block) and stop at
   the first rung that works. The cheapest line is the one you never write.
2. **Less prose** — drop the wind-up, the hedging, the narration of code that
   already speaks for itself. Answer first.
3. **Denser agent-to-agent handoffs** — when the reader is another agent, not a
   human, hand it the most token-efficient format it parses losslessly (compact /
   columnar JSON, or [ESO](eso/SPEC.md)). Cuts handoff size ~in half at zero loss
   of recovery. Fires only here — never as a user-facing answer.

Honey combines what [Ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail)
(minimal code) and [Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) (terse
prose) do separately, then goes further:

- **Auto-intensity** — `lite` / `full` / `ultra` chosen reflexively from the
  request, with no deliberation tax (it never spends reasoning tokens deciding
  *how* to comply — that would defeat the purpose on reasoning models).
- **Safety carve-outs** — input validation, error handling, auth, secrets,
  migrations, deletes, and anything you explicitly asked for are **never**
  compressed. Lazy ≠ broken.
- **A skill family, not one prompt** — an always-on core plus on-demand satellites
  (review, eco, gain, compress) and a *hive* of read-only subagents that return
  compressed handoffs. See [Skills & subagents](#skills--subagents).

## Why

Volume is cost. In agentic coding sessions, the volume of generated code and
prose is what runs up the bill — and most of it is waste.

This repo ships a **reproducible benchmark** ([`bench/`](bench/)) so you don't have
to take the numbers on faith: 17 tasks across three kinds of work — baseline vs
[Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) vs
[Ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) vs Honey — same model, same
prompts, only the skill changes. Correctness is objective (unit tests, structural /
accessibility checks, and lossless round-trip recovery for agent handoffs); quality
is scored by a **3-model judge panel** (median of Opus 4.8 + Sonnet 4.6 + Haiku 4.5).
The figures below are the committed results (Claude Opus 4.8, 3 runs each) — run
`cd bench && npm run bench` to reproduce.

A single blended number hides the story, because the levers fire differently per
task type. Quality is **% of baseline** (panel median; for handoffs, lossless
recovery); tokens are **generated output vs baseline**:

| Task tier | Caveman | Ponytail | **Honey** |
|-----------|:-------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| **Code** (12 unit-tested tasks) | 99% · −27% | 99% · **+39%** | **98% · −39%** |
| **User-facing** (3 landing/UI tasks) | 98% · −16% | 94% · −39% | **101% · +12%** |
| **Agent-to-agent** (2 handoff tasks) | 100% · −29% | 100% · −26% | **100% · −53%** |

Honey **leads quality where it matters most** — it tops the user-facing and
agent-to-agent tiers (the quality-separating ones) and stays within judge noise
of the pack on saturated code tasks — while cutting tokens where it's safe to:

- **Code** — the deepest cut (−39% output, −20% $) at essentially tied quality
  (98% vs 99%, within judge noise on tasks every variant passes). Caveman saves
  less; Ponytail's mandatory self-check *inflates* trivial code.
- **User-facing** — the carve-out keeps Honey from compressing polish, so it spends
  *more* (+12%) and earns the top quality score; Ponytail strips hardest and loses
  the most quality.
- **Agent-to-agent** — Honey's ESO/compact-JSON lever cuts handoff size in half
  with zero loss of recovery: its biggest, cleanest win.

## Efficient Structured Output

Honey includes [ESO](eso/SPEC.md), a zero-dependency, schema-first format for
agent handoffs. Repeated record keys are emitted once; declared row counts catch
truncated messages; JSON-compatible cells preserve types.

The reproducible [ESO/TOON/JSON benchmark](bench/eso/RESULTS.md) measures bytes,
two tokenizer estimates, codec speed, and lossless recovery across five agent
handoff shapes. Run it with `npm run bench:eso`.

```bash
printf '%s' '{"from":"reviewer","findings":[{"sev":"H","issue":"expired token"}]}' | eso encode
eso decode < handoff.eso
```

Pick Honey when you want the best quality-per-token, especially in Claude Code.

## Skills & subagents

Honey is one always-on core plus a family of on-demand tools. The core is a
*writing style* (it must be the default to pay off); the rest are *actions* you
reach for at a specific moment.

| Name | Kind | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `honey` | core skill (always-on) | the three levers, applied reflexively to every response. `/honey [lite\|full\|ultra\|off]` |
| `honey-design` | satellite skill | for user-facing UI (landing pages, components): keeps the full rendered polish, cuts tokens by writing the design densely (CSS vars, shared classes, `clamp()`) — same pixels, fewer tokens |
| `honey-review` | satellite skill | review a diff for over-engineering + over-verbosity; terse delete-list |
| `honey-eco` | satellite skill | this session's CO₂ / $ / tokens saved, from the committed EcoLogits port |
| `honey-gain` | satellite skill | the committed benchmark scoreboard (reads `bench/results/` at runtime) |
| `honey-compress` | satellite skill | rewrite a re-read memory file (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) tersely to cut *input* tokens; backs up the original |
| `honey-hive` | guide skill | decide when to delegate to the hive vs. work inline |
| `hive-scout` | subagent (haiku, read-only) | locate symbols / callers / configs; returns a compact id-keyed JSON map |
| `hive-reviewer` | subagent (haiku, read-only) | review a diff/files; returns columnar id-keyed JSON findings |
| `hive-builder` | subagent (sonnet, ≤2 files) | make a surgical edit under the ladder; returns a compact change-manifest |

The **hive** is Lever 3 with a runtime: each subagent returns a compressed handoff,
so the result injected back into the orchestrator's context is **−44–53%** smaller
with zero loss (`npm run bench:hive`). Live, the skills hold up too — honey −86%,
honey-review −70%, hive-reviewer −43% output tokens at passing correctness
(`npm run bench:skills`). See [`bench/hive/RESULTS.md`](bench/hive/RESULTS.md) and
[`bench/skills/RESULTS.md`](bench/skills/RESULTS.md).

On **user-facing** work — where the core skill *spends* tokens because polish is the
spec — `honey-design` keeps the same rendered polish for **−19% output tokens** vs no
skill (judge 92 vs 90), beating the core skill on both axes across 7 landing-page/UI
tasks. See [`bench/results/honey-design.md`](bench/results/honey-design.md).

> **Honesty note.** Earlier versions of this README quoted `92% / 78% / 73%` quality
> and `−57% / −65% / −70%` tokens from an unpublished run. Those don't reproduce —

> [`bench/`](bench/) harness actually produces; see

## Install

### Claude Code (plugin marketplace)

```
/plugin marketplace add Green-PT/honey-for-devs
/plugin install honey@greenpt
```

Then `/honey` to turn it on (`/honey lite|full|ultra` to set intensity,
`/honey off` to stop). A 🍯 badge shows the active mode in your statusline.

### One-line installer (auto-detects every agent you have)

macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-PT/honey-for-devs/main/install.sh | bash

## Carbon badge (Claude Code)

When Honey is active, the statusline also shows a live **CO₂ estimate** for the
session and the **CO₂/$ saved** vs a no-Honey baseline:

```
🍯 honey:full · 🌿 44g CO₂ (saved ~26g · $0.18)
```

(Illustrative — a ~2k-output-token Opus session.) The estimate is a faithful port
of [EcoLogits](https://github.com/genai-impact/ecologits) v0.8.2 (verified to match
the package exactly). **Model params come from EcoLogits' own registry**
([`hooks/eco-models.json`](hooks/eco-models.json), exported by
[`scripts/build-eco-models.py`](scripts/build-eco-models.py)) — matched by exact id,
falling back to a per-family alias for frontier models too new for the registry.
**Grid switches per provider** — Anthropic on AWS Trainium (~500 gCO₂/kWh), OpenAI
on Azure (~400), Google on GCP (~330). Aliases, grids, and per-mode savings live in
[`hooks/eco-config.json`](hooks/eco-config.json).

The badge itself renders **only in Claude Code** (it reads Claude Code's
transcript, where every model is a Claude model). The provider switching matters
for [`scripts/eco_report.py`](scripts/eco_report.py), which runs against any
transcript — Codex/Gemini CLIs would each need their own statusline hook to show
a live badge there.

> Params are **speculative** — Anthropic discloses none. EcoLogits' raw coefficient
> is a **single-stream (batch-size-1) upper bound** — it gives one request the whole
> GPU set for the full generation (for Opus, ~1.9 tok/s, ~30× slower than reality),
> which alone is ~1.4 kg per 1M output tokens. Production serves many requests
> concurrently, so the badge divides that ceiling by an effective batch concurrency
> (`serving_concurrency`, default 32 — calibrated so modeled throughput matches real
> ~50–70 tok/s serving) to show realistic **served** impact. `eco_report.py` prints
> both the served figure and the single-stream ceiling. Treat these as a range, not
> a meter reading.

For the full breakdown (usage + embodied + primary energy) run the real package:

```bash
pip install ecologits
python scripts/eco_report.py        # newest session, or --transcript PATH
```

## How it stays in sync

The skill is authored **once** in [`skills/honey/SKILL.md`](skills/honey/SKILL.md).
Every per-platform rule file (and `AGENTS.md`) is generated from it:

```bash
node scripts/build-rules.js          # regenerate all rule files
node scripts/build-rules.js --check  # CI: fail if any copy drifted
```
